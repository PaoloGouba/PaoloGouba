# Hey, I'm Paolo 👋  
**Integration Engineer · Building useful tools in my spare time**

🔗 I work as a **Technical Integration Specialist** in the SaaS industry, helping connect systems, APIs and workflows to deliver real business value.

🧠 On the side, I build lean tools to automate painful tasks and experiment with ideas — mainly in **AI automation, data compliance, and e-commerce**.
